# Henry Portfolio

## Introduction
It's a small React Native portfolio app for introducing myself:sunglasses: using React Native on Expo CLI for mobile apps and even web app!  
( Web version didn't optimized since the main focus of this project was mobile platforms ) 
    
      
## How to check the app out
### 1. Using Expo Go app
#### (Due to iOS policy, **only Android is available** using the link)
1. Go to "https://expo.dev/@playerprogramming/HenryPortfolio?serviceType=classic&distribution=expo-go"
2. Scan the QR code on the page using the 'camera app' or 'Expo app' and it would be ready to go.  
  
### 2. Locally  
1. git clone this repository
2. Type "npm start" or "expo start" [If expo or npm is already installed]
3. Enter "i" for iOS or "a" for Android, or scan the QR code on the console to check it out on your own device.
